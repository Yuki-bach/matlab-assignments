## Applied Linear Algebra

## Course Overview
##### Linear Algebra is the study of vector spaces and linear transformations on vector spaces. Linear Algebra is central to both pure and applied mathematics. Techniques from Linear Algebra are also used in analytic geometry, engineering, physics, natural science, computer science, and the social sciences. Topics include the use and application of matrices in the solution of systems of linear equations, determinants, real n-dimensional vector spaces, abstract vector spaces and their axioms, linear independence, span and bases for vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, matrix factorizations, and orthogonality. Computer explorations using MATLAB is an integral component of this course.
